# ADR004: Query Construction and Schema Management

## Status  
Proposed  

## Context  
The system must efficiently serve LLM-driven queries by constructing appropriate GraphQL/REST queries and ensuring schema updates for new data points.  

## Decision  
Implement a query constructor module with the following features:  
1. Supports multiple data sources (e.g., GraphQL, REST, RPC).  
2. Allows schema updates for dynamic data points without breaking existing queries.  
3. Validates and optimizes query execution plans.  

## Consequences  
### Benefits  
- Streamlined integration of new queries and data points.  
- Optimized performance through query validation and optimization.  

### Drawbacks  
- Requires continuous maintenance of schema definitions.  
- Complex query validation logic for diverse data sources.
