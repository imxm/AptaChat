# ADR003: Dynamic ETL for Flexible Data Points

## Status  
Proposed  

## Context  
The evolving nature of user queries necessitates a dynamic ETL pipeline that can accommodate new data points, sources, and transformations without code changes.  

## Decision  
Build a Dynamic ETL pipeline that:  
1. Extracts data points and their configurations from a central definition (e.g., metadata or user query).  
2. Parameterizes sources, transformations, and storage dynamically based on query requirements.  
3. Automatically deploys and integrates transformers for new data points.  

## Consequences  
### Benefits  
- High flexibility to adapt to evolving user queries.  
- Reduces downtime by avoiding redeployment for new data points.  

### Drawbacks  
- Requires robust error handling and validation mechanisms.  
- Higher complexity compared to static ETL.
