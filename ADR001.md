# ADR001: Modular Design Using IoC

## Status  
Accepted  

## Context  
The ETL pipeline must support:  
1. Static ETL for predefined data points.  
2. Dynamic ETL for user-defined, parameterized data points.  

The design must allow for easy integration of new sources, transformers, and storage mechanisms without affecting the pipeline's core functionality.  

## Decision  
Use the **Inversion of Control (IoC)** pattern. Define interfaces for the following components:  
- **Source Handlers**: Responsible for fetching data.  
- **Transformers**: Responsible for transforming data.  
- **Storage Handlers**: Responsible for storing the processed data.  

Pass these components as dependencies at runtime.  

## Consequences  
### Benefits  
- Highly modular and reusable components.  
- Simplifies the integration of new data points and functionalities.  
- Encourages clean, testable code.  

### Drawbacks  
- Slightly higher complexity during the setup.  
- Requires clear documentation of component interfaces.
