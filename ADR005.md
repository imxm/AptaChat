# ADR005: Caching Strategy for ETL Pipeline

## Status  
Proposed  

## Context  
To improve performance and reduce latency, the system needs an efficient caching mechanism to store frequently accessed data and transformed results.  

## Decision  
Implement a multi-layered caching strategy:  
1. **In-Memory Cache**: Store frequently accessed data for fast retrieval.  
2. **Database Cache**: Store larger datasets that are less frequently accessed.  
3. **Cache Eviction Policies**: Define TTL (time-to-live) and LRU (least recently used) policies for cache management.  

## Consequences  
### Benefits  
- Faster response times for repetitive queries.  
- Reduces load on external sources.  

### Drawbacks  
- Increased complexity in cache management.  
- Risk of stale data if not synchronized properly.
