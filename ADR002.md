# ADR002: Static ETL Using Fixed Data Points

## Status  
Accepted  

## Context  
Static ETL pipelines handle predefined data points (e.g., token volumes, wallet activities). These pipelines are simpler to implement and do not require runtime reconfiguration.  

## Decision  
Define the Static ETL pipeline with fixed sources, transformations, and storage steps:  
1. Fetch data from predefined sources (e.g., RPC endpoints, REST APIs).  
2. Apply predefined transformations (e.g., filter, aggregate, compute).  
3. Store the transformed data in a local database or cache.  

## Consequences  
### Benefits  
- Straightforward implementation for known data points.  
- Easier to debug due to predefined logic.  

### Drawbacks  
- Limited flexibility.  
- Adding new data points requires code modifications and redeployment.
